Today s formula is very important. Q1 is equal to K times Q2 by R square. We are using this formula for two charges. The force between the two charges can be attractive or repulsive. If you have given a question like this, you can find the distance between the two charges. This K is constant. K is equal to 1 by 4 pi epsilon naught. This value is 9 into 8 into the power of 9. Similarly, this value of epsilon naught is constant. 8.85 into 10 to the power of minus 12. The force between the two charges is 1 by 4 pi epsilon naught. If we write the unit as 8 to the power of minus 1, we get minus 2 and here we get the volume square. This is the simple term. The force between the two charges can be easily found. If we find the distance between the two charges, we get this R square and this F. If you understand how to change the formula, this term will be very easy for you.
